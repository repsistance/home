# WHO WE ARE

La RepsistancE is conceptually formed by every pioneer that supports Cardano project core values.

But if you ask who are the individuals that currently manage the stakepools and services like [LacedWhales][lacedwhales] or [Dandelion][dandelion], this is the current team:

* Roberto C. Morano: DevOps advocate, [Emurgo][emurgo] ex-employee. 
  * Twitter: https://twitter.com/rc_morano
  * LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcmorano
* Andrés Muñoz: DevOps advocate
  * LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andr%C3%A9s-mu%C3%B1oz-vera-56438a34

TL;DR: We are couple of seasoned Linux distributions developers with broad experience in the Systems Administration field and DevOps culture who perfectly align with the official Cardano Foundation skills requirements for pool operators:
