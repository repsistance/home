# dandelion.link: Cardano as Community Service

Dandelion Link is as a community service we run so anyone can use to start building on top of Cardano official APIs right here, right now; without the need of syncing the ledger locally.

And IT'S FREE! Forever. Unless you plan to use it for commercial projects ([contact us][contact-dandelion] for that :)

## Development

It's developed in [GimbaLabs][gimbalabs] platform and framework. Check the available endpoints [here][gimbalabs-opensource-apis] and dunno, [maybe][workshopmaybe], try one of the available [Cardano Starter Kits][gimbalabs-csk002] to speak Cardano with your friends and family!
